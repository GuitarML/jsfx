# Geraint's JSFX repository

This is a collection of audio effects I have written in REAPER's JSFX language.

Download them from [GitHub](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsfx), or [as a ZIP file](http://stash.reaper.fm/v/29933/Geraint%27s%20JSFX.zip), or on [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) by adding the repository: https://geraintluff.github.io/jsfx/index.xml

There's also a growing set of [video demos/tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLflIiXZOocKqgKexrkTxxtl6igGUWnpXK), although not all effects are covered (yet).

* PadSynth - a synth that produces thick sounds, including per-note effects and modulators ([audio demo](audio-demos/padsynth.mp3))
* Spring-Box - an echo/chorus effect ([audio demo](audio-demos/spring-box.mp3))
* Bad Connection - simulate poor connections by flipping between two volumes ([audio demo](audio-demos/Bad Connection/radio-dropout.mp3)), distortion, and a feedback delay line ([audio demo 2](audio-demos/bad-connection-spring-box-glitch.mp3)).
* Sandwich Amp - distortion module with a before/after filter pair, width control and secondary input ([audio demo](audio-demos/sandwich-amp.mp3))
* Warble - a basic pitch-editing effect
* Spectrum Matcher - analyse the difference between an input and a model, and optionally correct with EQ
* Smooth Limiter - a limiter that aims to have the correction curve as smooth as possible
* Panalysis - visualise and manipulate the stereo field of the audio
* Stereo Alignment Delay - two-channel delay and phase/delay analysis
* Learning Sampler - a basic sampler that records incoming audio and plays it back
* Hammer And Chord - a polyphonic string resonator/synth ([audio demo](audio-demos/hammer-and-chord.mp3))
* Hammer And String - a monophonic string resonator/synth with portamento ([audio demo](audio-demos/hammer-and-string.mp3))
* Humonica - harmoniser ([audio demo](audio-demos/humonica.mp3))
* MIDI Gate - a velocity-sensitive MIDI-controlled gate. Audio passes through only when MIDI note is down (or up, in "mute" mode). ([audio demo](audio-demos/midi-gate.mp3))
* MIDI Harmony - arpeggiator and auto-accompaniment plugin
* Echo Cycles - a delay effect where the feedback system moves echoes through the stereo field ([audio demo](https://geraintluff.github.io/jsfx/audio-demos/Echo-Cycles.mp3))

Presets (RPL) for these effects can be downloaded from GitHub.
