# Geraint's JSFX repository

This is a collection of audio effects I have written in REAPER's JSFX language.

Download them from [GitHub](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsfx) or on [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) by adding the repository: https://geraintluff.github.io/jsfx/index.xml

* Bad Connection - flips between two volumes to simulate poor connection or dropouts
* Dual Distortion - simple distortion with asymmetric parameters
* Spectrum Matcher - analyse the difference between an input and a model, and optionally correct with EQ

There are also some presets (RPL) available for [Bad Connection](Bad Connection.rpl) and [Spectrum Matcher](Spectrum Matcher.rpl).
