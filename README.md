# Geraint's JSFX repository

This is a collection of audio effects I have written in REAPER's JSFX language.

Download them from [GitHub](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsfx), or [as a ZIP file](http://stash.reaper.fm/v/29933/Geraint%27s%20JSFX.zip), or on [ReaPack](https://reapack.com/) by adding the repository: https://geraintluff.github.io/jsfx/index.xml

There's also a growing set of [video demos/tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLflIiXZOocKqgKexrkTxxtl6igGUWnpXK), although not all effects are covered (yet).
