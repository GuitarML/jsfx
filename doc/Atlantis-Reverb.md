# Atlantis Reverb

This is a reverb that specialises in long ambient sounds and shimmering textures.

The "grain" size controls the frequency/time resolution.  Longer grains will give smooth and pure tones, which shorter ones will result in a thicker and more wavering result.

Additionally the "sparkle" control feeds back octave-shifted versions of the same spectrum, adding extra brightness to the reverb.
