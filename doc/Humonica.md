# Humonica

This effect is a harmoniser - it works by periodically sampling the input, converting to a zero-phase impulse, and using that result to resynthesise notes. ([audio demo](audio-demos/humonica.mp3))

The resynthesised notes can sound very "bare", because they are made up of exact frequencies, however they can be softened with chorus. ([audio demo](audio-demos/humonica-spring-box.mp3) with Spring-Box chorus and reverb)
