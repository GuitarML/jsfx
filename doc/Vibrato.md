# Vibrato

This effect produces vibrato, using MIDI notes to give a more natural envelope to the vibrato.

When no notes are being played, no vibrato is added.  When a note is played, vibrato slowly appears, and stops when the note finishes.  When a new note is triggered, vibrato stops and then starts again.
